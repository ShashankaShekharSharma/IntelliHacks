# Quantum-Enhanced Trading System Architecture
This architecture outlines a modular, multi-layered trading system powered by quantum optimization, AI agents, and a feedback loop for continuous learning.

# Architecture Overview
1. Data Layer
  This layer ingests and processes raw financial and alternative data for feature extraction.
  Market and Alternative Data<br>
  i. Data Ingestion Agent: Prepares data for downstream usage<br>
  ii. Raw Data Store: Stores unprocessed data<br>
  iii. Feature Agent: Converts raw data to usable features<br>
  iv. Feature Store: Central hub of engineered features<br>

3. Analysis Layer
  i. Responsible for decision-making using AI and quantum agents.<br>
  ii. Quantum Optimization Agent: Generates optimal portfolio weights<br>
  iii. Risk Agent: Adjusts orders based on risk assessment<br>
  iv. Strategy Agents: Generate trade signals based on analysis<br>

4. Execution Layer
   i. Executes trade decisions while ensuring compliance.<br>
   ii. Orchestration Agent: Manages execution flow<br>
   iii. Execution Agent: Sends orders to brokers<br>
   iv. Broker API: Communicates with the financial markets<br> (Future)
   v. Compliance Agent: Verifies regulatory compliance<br> (Future)

5. Feedback and Optimization Layer
   i. Continuously improves the system using feedback loops.<br>
   ii. Feedback Agent: Monitors performance and outcomes<br>
   iii. Retraining Triggers: Detects when models need updating<br>
   iv. Strategy / Quantum Agents: Retrained based on performance<br>

# Key Highlights
  - Quantum Optimization for portfolio balancing<br>
  - AI Strategy Agents that evolve over time<br>
  - Real-time Execution with compliance checks<br>
  - Feedback Loop enables self-improvement through retraining triggers<br>
